# 360 Immersive Van Gogh Painting

An interactive application allowing for watching a three-dimensional world, which is an interpretation of Vincent van Gogh's painting "Starry Night", generated by AI. User can move the camera with mouse or finger as well as using gyroscpope sensor in mobile devices, getting VR-like experience.

## How does it works?

### Creating 3D background

- The background is actually a textured sphere created with Three.js. The geometry of the sphere is reversed so that the texture is inside the solid.
- The camera is placed inside the sphere, which gives the effect of a three-dimensional world.

### VR functionality

- The VR effect is achieved by using a gyroscope in the mobile device.
- Angular communicates with the sensor using the Device Orientation API.
- the data retrieved from the API is transformed into a rotation quanterion that rotates the Three.js camera depending on the position of the device in space.

⚠️ Important - In order to correctly represent rotation in 3D space using Device Orientation API, it is necessary to use quanterions or rotation matrices. Basing the rotations on pure sensor data (so-called Euler angles), we may encounter the Gimball Lock problem. This is perfectly described in [this article](https://dev.opera.com/articles/w3c-device-orientation-usage/#eulerlimitations).

## Installation Guide ⚙️
