# About The Project
The following project is an interactive eqirectangular image viewer, allowing for watching an illusion of the three-dimensional world. Users can move the camera manually or using gyroscpope sensor in mobile devices, getting VR-like experience.

# How does it work?

### 3D environment illusion
- The background is actually a textured sphere, created with Three.js.
- The geometry of the sphere is reversed so that the texture is inside the solid.
- The camera is placed inside the sphere, which gives the effect of a three-dimensional world.

### VR-like navigation
- The VR-like navigation is achieved via gyroscope & real-life position measurements.
- Angular web app communicates with the sensor using the Device Orientation API.
- The data retrieved from the API is transformed into a rotation quanterion, which rotates the Three.js camera depending on the position of the device in space.

> [!TIP]
> In order to correctly represent rotation in 3D space using Device Orientation API, it is necessary to use quanterions or rotation matrices. Using pure sensor data (Euler angles), we may encounter the Gimball Lock problem, leading to incorrect position representation.

## Installation Guide ‚öôÔ∏è

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started with the project.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14.0 or later)
